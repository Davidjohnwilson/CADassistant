Choices for CAD construction:

 standard/partial
        |
       \ /
 Projection operator: Collins,Hong,McCallum,Brown...
        |
       \ /
 Use equational constraints? (Requires McC/Brown)
        |
       \ /
 If so: single equational constraint, multiple (implicit), or TTICAD?
        |
       \ /
 Layered CAD? If so, how many layers?
        |
       \ /
 Manifold CAD? (Requires Equational Constraint(s))
        |
       \ /
 Need to evaluate on each cell? Quantifier Elimination?
